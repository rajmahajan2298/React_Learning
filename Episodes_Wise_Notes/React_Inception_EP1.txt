Topics Learned Today In React

(i) Firstly,we have seen the basic of HTML and JavaScript and
how to print Hello World in Both of them.

(ii) Then we have seen how to import React in our Project through CDN(Content Delivery Network) Links.
In those links we have two separate links one is for React Development and Other is for
React-Dom. React Dom help us in DOM Operations and Manipulations.

(iii) Then we have seen what is CORS(Cross-Origin) which helps us to request or use the
resources from other servers or through links like (Stylesheet, Script, iframes etc.).

(iv) React.createElement is an Object.

(v) We have seen what we put in the root element that only React will take care.
The root Element will replace the things on HTML page which is written inside root.
For Ex:-
If We have a an H1 element before root and after root

<h1> Heading Above Root </h1>
<div id="root">
  <h1>I'm an H1 Tag </h1>
</div>
<h1> Heading Below Root </h1>

The things inside root H1 Tag get replaced by the App.js File where React code is working.

(vi) root.render will take Object and will helps Browser to print the Data in the Form of
HTML.

(vii) If we have Nested Element We can Render them easily in React.
But if we have Multiple Sibling and Child we can render them with the help of
the Array or List.

(viii) Browser Do not understands the react code.

(ix) ReactElement(Object) ==> HTML (Browser Understands).
